“Wonderful evening of great music.  Thanks for the insights.  It’s like being in New York—maybe better!” 
Beautiful music for a wonderful summer evening! Your group is proof that Eastern Iowa is a place for dreams to come true.
Wonderful music from outstanding musicians! You guys are great!  I look forward to following you!  Consider me your newest loyal fan (or “cedar-head”)!
What a wonderful opportunity! WOW! The educational components made connections that made the music relevant to all of us.  A tremendous memorable experience
We love your music and always learn from you performances. Also, my husband stays awake—a miracle!
I loved every minute of it! Wonderful storytelling and awesome music!
before I started listening :| while i was listening :) after listening to this mix :D thanks for this mix I LOVE it 
thanks this will help me ease into sleep and forget the fact that I missed an exam.
Only problem with this mix is it's too good, I keep listening to the music rather than working, and looking up pieces so I can have them!
Oh My.. you got me with the very first song... I love that song!!! I got goosebumps all over.
